			     OS2TERM v1.00
		    Copyright 1993 by Jeff M. Garzik


OS2TERM is pretty simple and straightforward.  It arose out of my need
for decent 32-bit source code for dealing with modems.	This should
provide the OS/2 serial programmer with a decent head start.

The program itself was written using ONLY OS/2 system calls (no C
runtime library calls whatsoever), so I am pretty sure it will compile
on any OS/2 2.x C compiler.

The executable contained in this package was compiled with
emx/gcc 0.8g, but it does not require the EMX DLLs.  A makefile for emx
users (using GNU make) is provided.

Make sure you compile the source with the 'char' type defaulting to
'unsigned' to avoid a couple warnings.

I can be reached at jgarzik@pantera.atl.ga.us if you have any questions.

PSST.  Have you read the OS/2 Programming FAQ?
